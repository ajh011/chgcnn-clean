        The goal is to generalize the CGConv gated convolution structure to hyperedges. The 
        primary problem with such a generalization is the variable number of nodes contained 
        in each hyperedge (hedge). I propose we simply aggregate the nodes contained within 
        each hedge to complete the message, and then concatenate that with the hyperedge feature 
        to form the message.

        Below, the node attributes are first placed in order with their hyperedge_indices
        and then aggregated according to their hyperedges to form a component of the message corresponding to 
        each hyperedge
